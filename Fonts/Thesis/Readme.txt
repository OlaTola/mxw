About this version
------------------

These fonts are an homemade conversion from the Lucas Fonts Thesis Type 1 fonts to the OpenType-PS format for Mac and PC. These fonts are now 100% Unicode compliant, and are working well on the Mac like on the PC. All the 48 fonts from each Thesis main family are shown in the same font sub-menu in InDesign. The Caps and Expert fonts aren't integrated in the main fonts, but some OpenType features are present for the ligatures and alternate glyphs.

It was a very, very big job. But this is a full collection: 180 fonts!

Please read the included documentation, taken from the Lucas Fonts site, especially the end, about the Interpolation Theory.

NB 1: I've found only two small design errors in all these fonts. I've corrected the first: I've added small caps glyphs for the ligatures. But the second error remains: there is an alternate "y" glyph in the italic fonts, but the alternates "yacute" and "ydieresis" were forgotten. If you have some time, you can add them in the fonts and in the OpenType features...

Nb 2: FontShop is selling some "special" versions of Thesis (Thesis Basic, Thesis Correspondance...). They are not included here, because they are only stripped down versions of Thesis (without the small caps, without the features of the expert fonts). With Thesis OpenType, you do have them already!
